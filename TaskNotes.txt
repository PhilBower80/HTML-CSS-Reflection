(15mins) Match line-height of sidebar 

(160 mins) fixed HTML/CSS, rewrote using UL/LI tages for accessibility reasons.

(120 mins) animated sidebar - addded JS and transition effect to CSS.

(30 mins) figured out how to slide the main content of page so sidebar pushes it across screen. Using relative positioning and transition effect.

(30 mins) fixed header so that it displays above the sidebar which is fixed in position. Body now slides across to left to reveal the sidebar.

(60 mins) Added html/css/js for cookie

(30 mins) - fixed cookie overlapping with scrollbar.
